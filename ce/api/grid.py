    """Request centroid latitudes and longitudes of all cells within a
    given file.

    This is used for loading the front end with geographic extents
    information, from which enclosing polygons can be constructed in
    response to users clicking on a map.

    The grid call may only be called for a single data file per
    invocation.

    Args:
        sesh (sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session): A database Session object

        id_ (str): Unique id which is a key to the data file requested

    Returns:
        dict: Empty dictionary if id_ is not found in the database.

        Otherwise, returns a single dict with the key of the file's
        unique_id and the value consisting of a nested dictionary with
        the following attributes: 'latitudes', 'longitudes'.

        For example ::

            {'file0':
                {
                    'latitudes': [
                        -87.86380134,
                        -85.09652949,
                        -82.31291545, ...
                        ],
                    'longitudes': [
                        -180,
                        -177.1875,
                        -174.375, ...
                        ],
                    'modtime': datetime.datetime(2011, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11)
                }
            }

        There are two semi-error cases which should be mentioned, when
        the filesystem is out of sync with the database.

        1. The file pointed to by `id_` does not exist in the filesystem
        2. The requested variable does not exist in the given file

        In these the first case, an empty dict is returned.  In the
        second case, a dict with the id_ key and empty lists for
        latitudes and longtitudes is returned.

    Raises:
        None?
