# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../../ce'))

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'climate-explorer-backend'
copyright = '2019, James Hiebert'
author = 'James Hiebert'

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release = '1.1.1'


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'm2r']

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ['_templates']

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# We're using it to supress warnings on *.md files inlined with the include 
# command, which for some reason, sphinx doesn't count as source files.
exclude_patterns = ['api/*-usage.md', 
                    'api/api-overview.md', 
                    'api/sesh-not-needed.md', 
                    'api/rest-item.md',
                    'api/p2a-regions.md']


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'alabaster'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
